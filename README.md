# DIY Pigeon Repellent with Artificial Intelligence

## Real-Time Pigeon Detection with Raspberry Pi 4 and Coral Edge TPU Acceleration

The purpose of this project is to build a low-cost, low-power consumption pigeon repellent.
The algorithm can run in real-time on a Raspberry Pi 4, performing inference on TPU edge devices.

## Detection and Classification Models

The algorithm first performs object detection to detect birds with an SSDLite MobileDet network, pretrained on the COCO dataset.

and [labels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-coral/test_data/master/coco_labels.txt).

For each detected bird, the algorithm performs a bird classification second step using a MobilenetV2 network, pretrained on the iNaturalist 2017 (birds) dataset.

## Performance

The current implementation on the above-mentioned test video achieved a frame rate between ~12 and ~20 FPS.
The fluctuation of the performance is due to the varying number of classifications performed on the detected birds.
If needed, the frame rate could be either optimized by setting a maximum number of birds to be classified, or by adding more TPU for classification.

For better performance, two TPU devices are used where one performs detection, while the other performs classification.
Executing two different larger networks on one TPU requires swapping the model on the hardware, which results in performance loss.

The current processing pipeline is sequential, where each processing step has to wait for the previous one to finish.
In case of higher performance needs, enabling multi-threading would increase the utilization of the TPUs.
The API of the Coral TPU is expected to release the GIL, therefore multi-threading should be sufficient.
